Manage and monetize your online community — protect content, manage memberships, and connect your site to your Bora-Bora.io account.

== Description ==

**Bora Bora** is the easiest way to connect your WordPress website with your community on [Bora-Bora.io](https://bora-bora.io) — a complete platform for community growth, monetization and member management.

With this plugin you can:
- Protect pages and posts based on user roles and subscriptions
- Restrict access to members with active plans
- Automatically redirect users when their subscription expires
- Manage all member data securely through the Bora Bora backend
- Seamlessly integrate your Bora Bora account with your WordPress site

This plugin acts as a **bridge between WordPress and Bora-Bora.io**.
It does not handle payments or user registration directly, but connects to your Bora Bora community where subscriptions, roles and payments are managed.
Once connected, you can control access to your WordPress content based on each member’s role or subscription level.

If users are not authenticated or their subscription has expired, you can redirect them automatically to a custom page (e.g. login, sales, or signup).

### Why use Bora Bora?

- 🧩 **Easy setup:** Connect your Bora Bora API key in just a few minutes.
- 🔒 **Secure content protection:** Restrict access by role or membership level.
- 🔁 **Automatic session sync:** User access is updated automatically after upgrades or downgrades.
- ⚙️ **Full flexibility:** Works with any theme or custom post type.
- 💬 **Community-ready:** Ideal for Discord-based or membership communities.
