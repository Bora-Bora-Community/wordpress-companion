== Description ==

Bora Bora offers a complete solution for managing your community, from the subscription to the management of the users
and their access to the content.

The Bora Bora plugin is a free companion plugin for the services of the third party [Bora-Bora.io](https://bora-bora.io)
. It allows you to protect your pages by user role defined by the subscribed community. Therefore, you can use the
backend offered by Bora Bora.
 It also allows you to redirect users to a specific page if they are not authenticated or if their subscription has
 ended.
